/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces public read access for 'projects' and 'categories' while restricting write access to authorized users (not implemented in this version).
 * 'contacts' and 'supportRequests' collections are write-only.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /projects/{projectId}: Stores project details. Publicly readable.
 * - /categories/{categoryId}: Stores service category details. Publicly readable.
 * - /contacts/{contactId}: Stores contact form submissions. Write-only.
 * - /supportRequests/{supportRequestId}: Stores support requests. Write-only.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Projects and categories are publicly readable to showcase portfolio items and services.
 * - Contacts and support requests are write-only to accept user submissions without exposing data.
 * - No user authentication or authorization is implemented in this prototype. Write rules are set to 'false' as a placeholder for future implementation.
 * - List operations are generally disabled for submission collections like contacts and supportRequests.
