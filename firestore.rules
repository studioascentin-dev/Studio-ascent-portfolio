/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a public read-only model for 'projects' and 'categories',
 * allowing anyone to read project and category details. Writes to 'projects' and 'categories' are not allowed.
 * 'contacts' and 'supportRequests' collections only allows create operation.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /projects/{projectId}: Stores project details.
 * - /categories/{categoryId}: Stores service category details.
 * - /contacts/{contactId}: Stores contact form submissions from the homepage.
 * - /supportRequests/{supportRequestId}: Stores support requests for payment issues.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No user authentication or ownership is enforced in this initial prototype.
 * - Listing of 'contacts' and 'supportRequests' is explicitly denied.
 * - The ruleset prioritizes simplicity and assumes no user-specific data segregation.
