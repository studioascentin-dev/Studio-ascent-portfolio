/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the portfolio application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides public read access to projects and categories,
 * while restricting write access to these collections. Contact and support
 * requests are publicly accessible for both read and write to allow anonymous
 * users to submit the forms.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database contains top-level collections for 'projects', 'categories',
 * 'contacts', and 'supportRequests'.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Projects and categories are publicly readable, but writes are denied.
 * - Contacts and support requests are publicly readable and writable.
 *
 * Authorization Independence: No data denormalization is needed because no
 * collaborative features that need authorization exist.
