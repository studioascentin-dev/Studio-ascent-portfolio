/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the portfolio application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides public read access to projects and categories
 * while restricting write access to authorized users. The assumption is that
 * these collections are for showcasing data and are managed by the application owner.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /projects/{projectId}: Stores individual project details.
 * - /categories/{categoryId}: Stores service category details.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access is granted to both 'projects' and 'categories' collections.
 * - Write operations on both 'projects' and 'categories' are disallowed for all users.
